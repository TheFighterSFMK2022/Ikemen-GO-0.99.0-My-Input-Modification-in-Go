Hello. I have been trying to implement more buttons in Ikemengo for about 3 years. And I tried a lot to compile and configure Ikemengo until this year I was finally able to compile and modify it in the Go language. Thanks to CD2 and another IKEMEÃ‘ and I.K.E.M.E.N server on Discord I was able to compile modified Ikemengo. I was guided by https://github.com/ikemen-engine/Ikemen-GO/wiki/Building,-Installing-and-Distributing#building-on-windows as suggested by the I.K.E.M.E.N server. Downloading MinGW-w64 toolchain and the cmd command go get -u github.com/go-gl/gl/v2.1/gl because I am on version Ikemen-GO-0.99.0 and it needs version gov2.1 and the Goland or Go extension in Visual Code. Thank you very much to them for congratulating me. Good. I go almost directly to the problem. What I have managed to implement more buttons in ikemengo but a problem arises, when I press the "T" nothing happens, but if I press the "H" if the state 200 animation is done, but if I configure in data and The Kung Fu Man char in "kfm.Cmd" and change it to "T", the "H" still works and that is an error, I have tried many times to modify it in Go in Visual Code. here is the video of what I did in the code https://youtu.be/_v0aUjMdgsA and another video link that I forgot to add https://youtu.be/b0_yjavx7x8 I managed to get only the "H" to work but not the "T" and it works badly. I almost got it, it works 100%. but if I need help. if someone wants. I will be grateful.
